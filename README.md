# Latitude and Weather Analysis Dashboard

In this project, I created a visualization dashboard displaying the effects of latitude on city weather data. The variables analyzed included cloudiness, humidity, temperature, and wind speed.

The dasboard contains individual pages for each plot and the ability to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap were used in the creation of this website.

The website was displayed using github pages: https://arrrlette.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

Thank you for visiting my github page.
