# Web Visualization Dashboard

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard 

In this project, I created a visualization dashboard displaying city weather data. 

The dasboard contains individual pages for each plot and the ability to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

- describe components used (jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib, html/css, bootstrap
- describe ability to display properly on different screen sizes
- include deployment link (live website)
